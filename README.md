# Repository for "Data Analyst" Specialization (Yandex Practicum)

This is a repo of projects completed during 7-month DA training course at "Yandex Practicum".

Each project is assigned with its own designated folder containing all related files. Due to the exclusivity of the materials provided during the course, it is forbidden to publish datasets used in the projects but, however, all *Jupyter Notebook* files which contain the solution of the projects do include all explanations as well as data processing results in the cells executed.

## Folder structure

Project folders are structured by the following way:

```
|-- [project_folder_name]
    |-- README.md
    |-- [project_name].ipynb
```
* `README.md` - *Markdown* file containing description of  project;
* `*.ipynb` - *Jupyter Notebook* file consists project solution.
